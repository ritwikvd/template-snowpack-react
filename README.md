# **Development template for React with Snowpack**

`npx create-snowpack-react-with-tests` <br>
`npm i`

## How's this different from create-snowpack-app with template react?

For now, there are 2 main differences:

- Babel preset-react configuration for using jsx without having to import React.
- Swapped out web test runner/ chai for jest.
